## Source File Structure
test comment
### File Comments

Comments describing the contents of a source file are optional. They are discouraged for files that contain only a single abstraction (such as a class declaration)—in those cases, the documentation comment on the abstraction itself is sufficient and a file comment is only present if it provides additional useful information. File comments are allowed for files that contain multiple abstractions in order to document that grouping as a whole.

### Import Statements
A source file imports exactly the declarations that it needs—nothing more and nothing less. Do not rely on transitive imports (e.g., that SwiftUI also imports Foundation).

#### Declaration-Level Imports
Imports of individual declarations (struct, enum, class, etc.) are required over imports of whole modules. This practice ensures that dependencies between modules are explicit and granular.
* *Exception (Whole-Module Imports):* Importing an entire module is permitted for foundational system frameworks (e.g., SwiftUI, Foundation) or when a file uses a substantial number of declarations from a single module, making individual imports impractical and less readable.

#### Placement and Formatting
Import statements are the first non-comment tokens in a source file. They are never line-wrapped.
Imports should be grouped and sorted, but closely related imports (e.g. a framework and its extension library) should be placed together. The standard grouping order is:

* Apple frameworks (e.g., SwiftUI, Foundation, Combine)
* Third-party modules (including extensions to Apple frameworks):
- CombineExt(placed right after Combine)
- Other libraries (e.g. Alamofire, Kingfisher)
- Core modules first (Base, BaseUI, Shared)
- Project-internal and feature modules (AuthService, SomeCore)
- Specific imports (import enum SomeViews.SomeViewAction)

```swift
import Foundation
import SwiftUI
import Combine
import CombineExt
import Base
import BaseUI
import Shared
import AppError
import AuthService
import SomeCore
import enum SomeViews.SomeViewAction
import struct SomeViews.SomeViewState
```

### Type and Member Organization

This rule covers two aspects of organization: how types are arranged in files, and how members are ordered within a type.

#### File Organization
Group related top-level types in the same source file to improve cohesion and readability. This is encouraged for tightly coupled components, such as:
* A protocol and the primary class that conforms to it.
* A public type and its exclusive fileprivate helpers (e.g., error enums or small structs).

However, large, complex, or unrelated types must reside in their own separate files.

#### Member Ordering

To ensure consistency and predictability, the ordering of members within a type (class, struct, enum) must follow a strict, logical sequence. This makes code easier to navigate, review, and maintain.

The required order is as follows:

* Type Aliases and Nested Types: typealias, nested enum, struct, class.

* Properties: Stored and computed properties, grouped by access level (e.g., public, internal, private). Static properties come before non-static inside the current block. Constants (let) should precede variables (var).

* Initializers: All init methods, including required and convenience initializers.

* Public Methods: The primary public interface of the type.

* Private and Fileprivate Methods: Helper methods, often prefixed with private or fileprivate, which support the public interface.

```swift
public struct ProfileProgressView: View {
    typealias Action = () -> Void
    
    static let count = 1
    private let progress: Int
    private let action: Action?
    var buttonForegroundStyle: Color = .constant(.white)

    public init(progress: Int, action: Action? = nil) {
        self.progress = progress
        self.action = action
    }
    
    public var body: some View {
        //...
    }
    
    public func buttonForegroundStyle(_ color: Color) -> Self {
        //...
    }
    
    private func progressView(value: CGFloat) -> some View {
        //...
    }
}
```

### Overloaded Declarations

When a type has multiple initializers or subscripts, or a file/type has multiple functions with the same base name (though perhaps with different argument labels), *and* when these overloads appear in the same type or extension scope, they appear sequentially with no other code in between.

---

## General Formatting

### Column Limit

Swift code has a column limit of 110 characters. Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped as described in [Line-Wrapping](#line-wrapping).

**Exceptions:**
* Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible without breaking a meaningful unit of text that should not be broken (for example, a long URL in a comment).
* `import` statements.
* Code generated by another tool.

### Braces

In general, braces follow Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R) style for non-empty blocks with exceptions for Swift-specific constructs and rules:
* There **is no** line break before the opening brace (`{`).
  
* There **is a** line break after the opening brace (`{`), except in closures, where the signature of the closure is placed on the same line as the curly brace, if it fits, and a line break follows the `in` keyword.
  
* empty blocks may be written as `{}`.
  
* There **is a** line break before the closing brace (`}`), or it completes an empty block.
  
* There **is a** line break after the closing brace (`}`), *if and only if* that brace terminates a statement or the body of a declaration. For example, an `else` block is written `} else {` with both braces on the same line.

### One Statement Per Line

There is at most one statement per line, and each statement is followed by a line break.

Exception: A line may end with a block that contains zero or one statement. This is often used for concise control flow or simple closures.
```swift
switch someEnum {
    case .first: 5
    case .second: 10
    case .third: 20
}

let squares = numbers.map { $0 * $0 }

var someProperty: Int { otherObject.somethingElse() }
```
#### Clarification: Context Matters (UI vs. Logic) 💡
While the compact, single-line form is permitted by the general rule, its application should be contextual. For the sake of readability and maintainability, we distinguish between UI code and logic/flow control code.

#### ❌ In UI Code (SwiftUI Views, UIKit View Configuration)

In declarative UI code, readability is the highest priority. The structure of the code should mirror the structure of the UI itself. Therefore, single-line blocks are not allowed for UI components, as they can obscure the view hierarchy. Always use multi-line formatting for clarity.

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    HStack {
        Text(.constant(.title)).font(.constant(.boldTitle)); Button(.constant(.btnLogOut)) { viewModel.send(action: .logOut) }
    }
    ```

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    HStack {
      Text(.constant(.title))
          .font(.constant(.boldTitle))

      Button(.constant(.btnLogOut)) {
          viewModel.send(action: .logOut)
      }
    }
    ```

#### ✅ In Logic Code (Flow/Coordinator/ViewModel/Service Modules)

In imperative logic code, the single-line format is allowed and often preferred for simple, self-contained operations. This is common for control flow statements (guard, if), cleanup (defer), or simple transformations (map, filter). It helps reduce vertical space and keeps simple logic self-contained.

### Line-Wrapping
#### Function Declarations
Function declarations are wrapped when they exceed the maximum line length. The wrapping follows a consistent, cascading indentation style to maintain readability.

##### Arguments and Closing Parenthesis
When a function's argument list is wrapped, the following rules apply:
* Each argument must be on its own line.
* Wrapped arguments are indented with a single +4 space indent.
* The closing parenthesis ) must be placed on a new line, aligned with the func keyword.

```swift
public protocol ExampleDelegate {
    func example(
        _ example: Example,
        someValue: SomeValue
    )
}
```
##### Generic Parameters and where Clauses
Generics and their constraints have specific wrapping rules to preserve clarity.
* If the generic parameter list (<...>) causes the function's first line to exceed 60 characters, the generic parameters must be wrapped. Each parameter is placed on a new line with a +4 indent. The closing > is placed on its own line after the last parameter.
* The where keyword is placed on the same line as the return type. If the constraints themselves need to be wrapped, the first constraint remains with where, and subsequent constraints are placed on new lines, aligned under the first.

```swift
// Generic parameters and 'where' clause are wrapped
public func find<
    Element: Equatable,
    CollectionType: Collection
>(
    element: Element,
    in collection: CollectionType
) -> CollectionType.Index? where CollectionType.Element == Element,
                                 CollectionType.Index: Hashable {
    // ...
}
```

#### Type and Extension Declarations

The examples below apply equally to `class`, `struct`, `enum`, `extension`, and `protocol` (with the obvious exception that all but the first do not have superclasses in their inheritance list, but they are otherwise structurally similar).

```swift
struct MyClass: MySuperclass,
                MyProtocol,
                SomeoneElsesProtocol,
                SomeFrameworkProtocol {
    // ...
}

struct MyContainer<
    ViewModel: BaseViewModel
>: MyContainerSuperclass,
   MyContainerProtocol,
   SomeoneElsesContainerProtocol,
   SomeFrameworkContainerProtocol {
    // ...
}

struct MyContainer<
    ViewModel: BaseViewModel
>: MyContainerSuperclass,
   MyContainerProtocol,
   SomeoneElsesContainerProtocol,
   SomeFrameworkContainerProtocol where BaseCollection: Collection {
    // ...
}

struct MyContainer<
    ViewModel: BaseViewModel
>: MyContainerSuperclass,
   MyContainerProtocol,
   SomeoneElsesContainerProtocol,
   SomeFrameworkContainerProtocol where BaseCollection: Collection,
                                        BaseCollection.Element: Equatable,
                                        BaseCollection.Element: SomeOtherProtocolOnlyUsedToForceLineWrapping {
    // ...
}

struct MyContainer<
    ViewModel: BaseViewModel
>: MyContainerSuperclass,
   MyContainerProtocol,
   SomeoneElsesContainerProtocol,
   SomeFrameworkContainerProtocol
where BaseCollection: Collection,
      BaseCollection.Element: Equatable,
      BaseCollection.Element: SomeOtherProtocolOnlyUsedToForceLineWrapping {
    // ...
}
```
#### Function Calls

When a function call is line-wrapped, each argument is written on its own line, indented +4 from the original line.

As with function declarations, if the function call terminates its enclosing statement and ends with a closing parenthesis (`)`) (that is, it has no trailing closure), then the parenthesis may be placed *either* on the same line as the final argument *or* on its own line.

```swift
let index = index(
    of: veryLongElementVariableName,
    in: aCollectionOfElementsThatAlsoHappensToHaveALongName
)

let index = index(of: veryLongElementVariableName,
                  in: aCollectionOfElementsThatAlsoHappensToHaveALongName)
```

If the function call ends with a trailing closure and the closure’s signature must be wrapped, then place it on its own line and wrap the argument list in parentheses to distinguish it from the body of the closure below it.

```swift
someAsynchronousAction.execute(withDelay: howManySeconds, context: actionContext) { context in
    doSomething(withContext: context)
}
```

### Horizontal Whitespace

**Terminology note:** In this section, *horizontal whitespace* refers to *interior* space. These rules are never interpreted as requiring or forbidding additional space at the start of a line.

Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from literals and comments, a single Unicode space also appears in the following places **only**:
1. Separating any reserved word starting a conditional or switch statement (such as `if`, `guard`, `while`, or `switch`) from the expression that follows it if that expression starts with an open parenthesis (`(`).

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    if(x == 0 && y == 0) || z == 0 {
        // ...
    }
    ```

2. Before any closing curly brace (`}`) that follows code on the same line, before any open curly brace (`{`), and after any open curly brace (`{`) that is followed by code on the same line.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let nonNegativeCubes = numbers.map { $0 * $0 * $0 }.filter { $0 >= 0 }

    let nonNegativeCubes = numbers.map{$0 * $0 * $0}.filter{$0 >= 0}
    ```

3. **On both sides** of any binary or ternary operator, including the “operator-like” symbols described below, with exceptions noted at the end:

* The `=` sign used in assignment, initialization of variables/properties, and default arguments in functions.

!!! success "Збс"

### Horizontal Alignment

**Terminology note:** *Horizontal alignment* is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.

Horizontal alignment is forbidden except when writing obviously tabular data where omitting the alignment would be harmful to readability. In other cases (for example, lining up the types of stored property declarations in a `struct` or `class`), horizontal alignment is an invitation for maintenance problems if a new member is introduced that requires every other member to be realigned.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    struct DataPoint {
        var value: Int
        var primaryColor: UIColor
    }
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    struct DataPoint {
        var value:        Int
        var primaryColor: UIColor
    }
    ```
### Vertical Whitespace

A single blank line appears in the following locations:
1. Between consecutive members of a type: properties, initializers, methods, enum cases, and nested types, **except that**:
* A blank line is optional between two consecutive stored properties or two enum cases whose declarations fit entirely on a single line. Such blank lines can be used to create **logical groupings** of these declarations.
* A blank line is optional between two extremely closely related properties that do not otherwise meet the criterion above; for example, a private stored property and a related public computed property.
2. **Only as needed** between statements to organize code into logical subsections.
3. **Optionally** before the first member or after the last member of a type (neither is encouraged nor discouraged).
4. Anywhere explicitly required by other sections of this document.

**Multiple** blank lines are permitted, but never required (nor encouraged). If you do use multiple consecutive blank lines, do so consistently throughout your code base.

### Parentheses

Parentheses are **not** used around the top-most expression that follows an `if`, `guard`, `while`, or `switch` keyword.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    if x == 0 {
        print("x is zero")
    }
    
    if (x == 0 || y == 1) && z == 2 {
        print("...")
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    if (x == 0) {
        print("x is zero")
    }
    
    if ((x == 0 || y == 1) && z == 2) {
        print("...")
    }
    ```
Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when the author and the reviewer agree that there is no reasonable chance that the code will be misinterpreted without them, nor that they would have made the code easier to read. It is **not** reasonable to assume that every reader has the entire Swift operator precedence table memorized.

---

## Formatting Specific Constructs
### Non-Documentation Comments

Non-documentation comments always use the double-slash format (`//`), never the C-style block format (`/* ... */`).

### Properties

Local variables are declared close to the point at which they are first used (within reason) to minimize their scope.

With the exception of tuple destructuring, every `let` or `var` statement (whether a property or a local variable) declares exactly one variable.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    var a = 5
    var b = 10
    let (quotient, remainder) = divide(100, 9)
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    var a = 5, b = 10
    ```
### Switch Statements

- In multi-line cases, case statements are aligned with switch (no extra indentation).
- In single-line cases, case statements are indented one level (+4 spaces) from switch.
- The body of a case in multi-line format is indented +4 spaces from the case.
- Use single-line case only if the body is short (≈ 40 characters or less).
- The 40-character limit is approximate — developers may decide to switch to multi-line for better readability even with fewer characters.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    switch self {
        case .status: .congratulations(.status)
        case .reward(let multiplier): "\(multiplier) \(String.congratulations(.rewards))"
        case .coins(let value):  "\(value) \(String.congratulations(.coins))"
    }
    
    switch action {
    case .appeared, .error:
        return update(for: state)
    case .selected(let id):
        return changeSelected(for: state, id: id)
    case .close:
        coordinator.perform(.close)
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    switch action {
        case .appeared, .error:
            return update(for: state)
        case .selected(let id):
            return changeSelected(for: state, id: id)
        case .close:
            coordinator.perform(.close)
    }
    
    switch self {
    case .status: .congratulations(.status)
    case .reward(let multiplier): "\(multiplier) \(String.congratulations(.rewards))"
    case .coins(let value):  "\(value) \(String.congratulations(.coins))"
    }
    ```

### Enum Naming
The naming convention for enums depends on their role. The primary rule is to use singular names for enums that define a type, but plural names are acceptable when an enum is used as a namespace.
**The Main Rule: Singular for Types**
When an enum is used to define a type with distinct states or values, its name must be singular.

Think of it this way: the type is Direction, and a variable of that type can hold one of its values, such as .north. We don't write let myDirection: Directions.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    // An enum as a type representing one state out of several.
    public enum Status {
        case achieved
        case current
        case unavailable
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // Avoid plural names for type names.
    enum NetworkStates { ... }
    
    enum PaymentMethods { ... }
    ```
The Exception: Plural for Namespaces

When a caseless enum is used as a namespace to group static constants, a plural name is appropriate and often preferred because it describes the group or collection of items stored within.

If the enum has more than three cases, treat it as a collection and use a plural name (ending with s).
This improves readability and signals that the enum represents a group of values rather than a single type.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    enum Constants {
    
        enum Images: String, ImageKey {
            case box
            case congratulation
            case coinsSpecial
            case userPhotoPlaceholder
            
            var bundle: Bundle? { .module }
        }
    
        enum Strings {
            
            enum Levels: String, LevelsLocalizedKey {
                case title = "levels.title"
                case subtitle = "levels.subtitle"
                case level = "levels.level"
                case coinsTitle = "levels.coins_text"
                case rewardsTitle = "levels.rewards_title"
                case statusDescription = "levels.status_description"
                case rewardDescription = "levels.reward_description"
                case coinsDescription = "levels.coins_description"
            }
        }
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // Too many cases, but still singular — harder to read
    enum Image { 
        case box
        case congratulation
        case coinsSpecial
        case userPhotoPlaceholder
    }
```
    
### Enum Cases

In general, there is only one `case` per line in an `enum`. The comma-delimited form may be used only when none of the cases have associated values or raw values, all cases fit on a single line, and the cases do not need further documentation because their meanings are obvious from their names.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    public enum Token {
        case comma
        case semicolon
        case identifier
    }
    
    public enum Token {
        case comma, semicolon, identifier
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    public enum Token {
        case comma
        case semicolon
        case identifier(String)
    }
    
    public enum Token {
        case comma, semicolon, identifier(String)
    }
    ```

When an `enum` case does not have associated values, empty parentheses are never present.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    public enum BinaryTree<Element> {
        indirect case node(element: Element, left: BinaryTree, right: BinaryTree)
        case empty
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    public enum BinaryTree<Element> {
        indirect case node(element: Element, left: BinaryTree, right: BinaryTree)
        case empty()
    }
    ```
The cases of an enum must follow a logical ordering that the author could explain if asked. If there is no obviously logical ordering, use a lexicographical ordering based on the cases’ names.

In the following example, the cases are arranged in numerical order based on the underlying HTTP status code.
```swift
public enum HTTPStatus: Int {
    case ok = 200
    case badRequest = 400
    case notAuthorized = 401
    case paymentRequired = 402
    case forbidden = 403
    case notFound = 404
    case internalServerError = 500
}
```
The following version of the same enum is less readable. Although the cases are ordered lexicographically, the meaningful groupings of related values has been lost.
```swift
public enum HTTPStatus: Int {
    case badRequest = 400
    case forbidden = 403
    case internalServerError = 500
    case notAuthorized = 401
    case notFound = 404
    case ok = 200
    case paymentRequired = 402
}
```
### Trailing Closures

Functions should not be overloaded such that two overloads differ **only** by the name of their trailing closure argument. Doing so prevents using trailing closure syntax—when the label is not present, a call to the function with a trailing closure is ambiguous.

Consider the following example, which prohibits using trailing closure syntax to call `greet`:
```swift
func greet(enthusiastically nameProvider: () -> String) {
    print("Hello, \(nameProvider())! It's a pleasure to see you!")
}
func greet(apathetically nameProvider: () -> String) {
    print("Oh, look. It's \(nameProvider()).")
}

greet { "John" }  // arror: ambiguous use of 'greet'
```
This example is fixed by differentiating some part of the function name other than the closure argument—in this case, the base name:
```swift
func greetEnthusiastically(_ nameProvider: () -> String) {
    print("Hello, \(nameProvider())! It's a pleasure to see you!")
}
func greetApathetically(_ nameProvider: () -> String) {
    print("Oh, look. It's \(nameProvider()).")
}

greetEnthusiastically { "John" }
greetApathetically { "not John" }
```
If a function call has multiple closure arguments, then **none** are called using trailing closure syntax; **all** are labeled and nested inside the argument list’s parentheses.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    UIView.animate(
        withDuration: 0.5,
        animations: {
            // ...
        },
        completion: { finished in
            // ...
        }
    )

    // Use modern multiple trailing closure syntax.
    // The code reads like a native control flow statement.
    UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
        // ...
    } completion: {  finished in
        // ...
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    UIView.animate(
        withDuration: 0.5,
        animations: {
            // ...
        }) { finished in
            // ...
        }
    ```

If a function has a single closure argument and it is the final argument, then it is **always** called using trailing closure syntax, except in the following cases to resolve ambiguity or parsing errors:
* As described above, labeled closure arguments must be used to disambiguate between two overloads with otherwise identical arguments lists.
* Labeled closure arguments must be used in control flow statements where the body of the trailing closure would be parsed as the body of the control flow statement.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 30, repeats: false) { timer in
        print("Timer done!")
    }
    if let firstActive = list.first(where: { $0.isActive }) {
        process(firstActive)
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 30, repeats: false, block: { timer in
        print("Timer done!")
    })
    // This example fails to compile.
    if let firstActive = list.first { $0.isActive } {
        process(firstActive)
    }
    ```
When a function called with trailing closure syntax takes no other arguments, empty parentheses (`()`) after the function name are **never** present.
!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let squares = [1, 2, 3].map { $0 * $0 }
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    let squares = [1, 2, 3].map({ $0 * $0 })
    let squares = [1, 2, 3].map() { $0 * $0 }
    ```

### Trailing Commas

Trailing commas in array and dictionary literals are required. The last element in a multi-line literal must have a comma following it.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let configurationKeys = [
        "bufferSize",
        "compression",
        "encoding",
    ]
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    let configurationKeys = [
        "bufferSize",
        "compression",
        "encoding"
    ]
    ```

### Attributes
Parameterized attributes (such as `@availability(...)` or `@objc(...)`) are each written on their own line immediately before the declaration to which they apply, are lexicographically ordered, and are indented at the same level as the declaration.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    @available(iOS 9.0, *)
    public func coolNewFeature() {
        // ...
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    @available(iOS 9.0, *) public func coolNewFeature() {
        // ...
    }
    ```

## Naming

### Naming Conventions Are Not Access Control

Restricted access control (`internal`, `fileprivate`, or `private`) is preferred for the purposes of hiding information from clients, rather than naming conventions.

Naming conventions (such as prefixing a leading underscore) are only used in rare situations when a declaration must be given higher visibility than is otherwise desired in order to work around language limitations—for example, a type that has a method that is only intended to be called by other parts of a library implementation that crosses module boundaries and must therefore be declared `public`.

### Identifiers

In general, identifiers contain only 7-bit ASCII characters. Unicode characters are not allowed.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let smile = "😊"
    let deltaX = newX - previousX
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    let 😊 = "😊"
    ```
### Initializers
For clarity, initializer arguments that correspond directly to a stored property have the same name as the property. Explicit `self.` is used during assignment to disambiguate them.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    public struct CongratulationsViewData {
        public let user: User
        public let rewards: [Reward]
        
        public init(user: User, rewards: [Reward]) {
            self.user = user
            self.rewards = rewards
        }
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    public struct CongratulationsViewData {
        public let user: User
        public let rewards: [Reward]
        
        public init(user otherUser: User, rewards otheRrewards: [Reward]) {
            user = otherUser
            rewards = otheRrewards
        }
    }
    ```
### Static and Class Properties

Static and class properties that return instances of the declaring type are **not** suffixed with the name of the type.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    public class UIColor {
        public class var red: UIColor {
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    public class URLSession {
        public class var shared: URLSession {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    public class UIColor {
        public class var redColor: UIColor {
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    public class URLSession {
        public class var sharedSession: URLSession {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
When a static or class property evaluates to a singleton instance of the declaring type, the names `shared` and `default` are commonly used. This style guide does not require specific names for these; the author should choose a name that makes sense for the type.

### Global Constants

Like other variables, global constants are `lowerCamelCase`. Hungarian notation, such as a leading `g` or `k`, is not used.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let secondsPerMinute = 60
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    let SecondsPerMinute = 60
    let kSecondsPerMinute = 60
    let gSecondsPerMinute = 60
    let SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60
    ```

### Properties
The `get` block for a read-only computed property is omitted and its body is directly nested inside the property declaration.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    var totalCost: Int { items.sum { $0.cost } }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    var totalCost: Int {
        get {  items.sum { $0.cost } }
    }
    ```

### Arrays Initialization
Arrays are initialized with shorthand literals [] whenever possible.
The explicit form [Element]() is used only when required by the compiler, such as in generic contexts (e.g., inside reduce, map, or when type inference is ambiguous).

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let numbers: [Int] = []
    let names = ["Evan", "Baxter"]
    
    let result = values.reduce(into: [Int]()) { result, element in
        result.append(element.id)
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    let numbers = [Int]() // use [] if type is known
    let emptyNames: [String] = [String]() // redundant
    ```

### Optional Types

Sentinel values are avoided when designing algorithms (for example, an “index” of −1 when an element was not found in a collection). Sentinel values can easily and accidentally propagate through other layers of logic because the type system cannot distinguish between them and valid outcomes.

`Optional` is used to convey a non-error result that is either a value or the absence of a value. For example, when searching a collection for a value, not finding the value is still a **valid and expected** outcome, not an error.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    func index(of thing: Thing, in things: [Thing]) -> Int? {
        // ...
    }
    
    if let index = index(of: thing, in: lotsOfThings) {
        // Found it.
    } else {
        // Didn't find it.
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    func index(of thing: Thing, in things: [Thing]) -> Int {
        // ...
    }
    
    let index = index(of: thing, in: lotsOfThings)
    if index != -1 {
        // Found it.
    } else {
        // Didn't find it.
    }
    ```

Conditional statements that test that an `Optional` is non-nil *but do not access the wrapped value* are written as comparisons to `nil`. The following example is clear about the programmer’s intent:

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    if value != nil {
        print("value was not nil")
    }
    ```
This example, while taking advantage of Swift’s pattern matching and binding syntax, obfuscates the intent by appearing to unwrap the value and then immediately throw it away.
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    if let _ = value {
        print("value was not nil")
    }
    ```

### Access Levels

Specifying an explicit access level at the file level on an extension is permitted.
Each member of the extension should not specify an explicit access level if it matches the extension’s level.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    public extension String {
        var isUppercase: Bool {
            // ...
        }

        var isLowercase: Bool {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    extension String {
        public var isUppercase: Bool {
            // ...
        }

        public var isLowercase: Bool {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```

### Nesting and Namespacing

Swift allows `enums`, `structs`, and `classes to be nested, so nesting is preferred (instead of naming conventions) to express scoped and hierarchical relationships among types when possible. For example, flag `enums or error types that are associated with a specific type are nested in that type.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    struct Parser {
        enum Error: Swift.Error {
            case invalidToken(String)
            case unexpectedEOF
        }

        func parse(text: String) throws {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    struct Parser {
        func parse(text: String) throws {
            // ...
        }
    }
    enum ParseError: Error {
        case invalidToken(String)
        case unexpectedEOF
    }
    ```
Swift does not currently allow protocols to be nested in other types or vice versa, so this rule does not apply to situations such as the relationship between a controller class and its delegate protocol.

Declaring an `enum` without cases is the canonical way to define a “namespace” to group a set of related declarations, such as constants or helper functions. This `enum` automatically has no instances and does not require that extra boilerplate code be written to prevent instantiation.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    enum Dimension {
        static let tileMargin: CGFloat = 8
        static let tilePadding: CGFloat = 4
        static let tileContentSize: CGSize(width: 80, height: 64)
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    struct Dimensions {
        private init() {}

        static let tileMargin: CGFloat = 8
        static let tilePadding: CGFloat = 4
        static let tileContentSize: CGSize(width: 80, height: 64)
    }
    ```
    
### fallthrough in switch Statements
When multiple cases of a switch would execute the same statements, the case patterns are combined into ranges or comma-delimited lists. Multiple case statements that do nothing but fallthrough to a case below are not allowed.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    switch value {
    case 1:
        print("one")
    case 2...4:
        print("two to four")
    case 5, 7:
        print("five or seven")
    default:
        break
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    switch value {
    case 1:
        print("one")
    case 2:
        fallthrough
     case 3:
        fallthrough
    case 4:
        print("two to four")
    case 5:
        fallthrough
    case 7:
        print("five or seven")
    default:
        break
    }
    ```
In other words, there is never a case whose body contains only the fallthrough statement. Cases containing additional statements which then fallthrough to the next case are permitted.

### Pattern Matching
The placement of let and var keywords in a pattern depends on the number of values being bound within that pattern.
- For patterns with a single binding, place the keyword directly before the variable (case .name(let value)).
- For patterns with two or more bindings, use the shorthand version where the keyword precedes the entire pattern (case let .name(value1, value2)).

This approach maintains clarity for simple, single-value cases while reducing verbosity and repetition in more complex cases with multiple values.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    switch serverResponse {
    case .success(let data):
        print("Received (data.count) bytes.")
    case let .failure(code, message):
        print("Error \(code): \(message)")
    case .notModified:
        break
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    switch serverResponse {
    case let .success(data):
        print("Received (data.count) bytes.")
    case .failure(let code, let message):
        print("Error \(code): \(message)")
    case .notModified:
        break
    }
    ```
Labels of tuple arguments and enum associated values are omitted when binding a value to a variable with the same name as the label.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    switch treeNode { 
        case .subtree(let left, let right): // ... 
        case .leaf(let element): // ... 
    }
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // Including the labels adds redundant noise.
    switch treeNode {
        case .subtree(left: let left, right: let right): // ...
        case .leaf(element: let element): // ...
    }
    ```

### Tuple Patterns
Assigning variables through a tuple pattern is only permitted if the left-hand side of the assignment is unlabeled.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let (a, b) = (y: 4, x: 5.0)
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // Labels on the left-hand side resemble type annotations and can be confusing.
    let (x: a, y: b) = (y: 4, x: 5.0)

    // This declares two variables: `Int` (which is a `Double`) and `Double` (which is an `Int`). `x` and `y` are not variables.
    let (x: Int, y: Double) = (y: 4, x: 5.0)
    ```
    
### Numeric and String Literals
When a literal is used to initialize a value of a type other than its default, specify the type explicitly.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    // These are explicitly typed.
    let x2: Int32 = 50
    let x3 = 50 as Int32

    let y2: Character = "a"
    let y3 = "a" as Character

    // GOOD. The compiler emits errors for invalid coercions, which is safe.
    // error: integer literal '...' overflows when stored into 'Int64'
    let a = 0x8000_0000_0000_0000 as Int64
    // error: cannot convert value of type 'String' to type 'Character'
    let b = "ab" as Character
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // Using initializer syntax can lead to misleading compiler errors or runtime errors.

    // This fails to compile because the literal doesn't fit into a signed `Int` first.
    let a1 = UInt64(0x8000_0000_0000_0000)

    // This is significantly slower than coercion.
    let b = Character("a")

    // This traps at runtime.
    let c = Character("ab")
    ```

### Optionals: Safe Mapping vs. Force Unwrapping
For transforming optional values, always prefer safe mapping (map, flatMap) over force unwrapping (!) or unnecessary conditional nesting.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let optionalString: String? = "123" 
    let optionalInt = optionalString.flatMap(Int.init)
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    let optionalString: String? = "123"

    let optionalInt: Int?
    
    if optionalString != nil { 
        optionalInt = Int(optionalString!)
    } else { 
        optionalInt = nil 
    }
    ```
Use explicit unwrapping (!) only when the value is guaranteed to be non-nil by program logic, and a crash is acceptable in case of violation.

### Single-Sentence Summary

Documentation comments begin with a brief single-sentence summary. Method summaries are verb phrases; property summaries are noun phrases.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    /// The background color of the view.
    var backgroundColor: UIColor

    /// Returns the sum of the numbers in the given array.
    func sum(_ numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
        // ...
    }
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    /// This property is the background color of the view.
    var backgroundColor: UIColor

    /// This method returns the sum of the numbers in the given array.
    func sum(_ numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
      // ...
    }
    ```
### Higher-Order Functions for Collections

Prefer using higher-order functions like map, filter, reduce, and flatMap for common collection operations over constructing manual for-in loops. This practice leads to more declarative, concise, and readable code by clearly stating the transformation's intent rather than the step-by-step mechanics of its implementation. It also avoids the boilerplate of creating and mutating intermediate collections.

Furthermore, for transformations that simply access a property of an element, you can use the even more concise KeyPath expression (\.propertyName). This further improves readability by directly referencing the property being mapped.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift 
    // The intent—transforming and filtering—is immediately clear.
    let squaredEvens = numbers.map { $0 * $0 }.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
    
    // Using a KeyPath is the most direct way to extract properties.
    let userNames = users.map(\.name)
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift  
    // This imperative approach requires more code and mental overhead to understand. 
    var squaredEvens: [Int] = []
    
    for number in numbers {
        let squared = number * number if squared % 2 == 0 { squaredEvens.append(squared) } 
    } 
    ```
    
### Transforming Optionals with map and flatMap

Prefer map and flatMap to perform transformations on optional values rather than using verbose if let or guard let statements. This approach produces more concise, declarative code by chaining the operation directly to the optional value itself.

Use map when your transformation function returns a non-optional value. Use flatMap when your transformation function returns an Optional value; this prevents creating a nested optional (e.g., Int??).

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    // 'map' is used because the transform returns a non-optional String.
    let optionalNumber: Int? = 42
    let optionalDescription = optionalNumber.map { "The number is ($0)" }
    
    // 'flatMap' is used because `Int(String)` returns an `Int?`.
    let optionalString: String? = "123"
    let optionalInt = optionalString.flatMap { Int($0) }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // Unnecessarily verbose for a simple transformation.
    let optionalNumber: Int? = 42
    let optionalDescription: String?
    
    if let number = optionalNumber {
        optionalDescription = "The number is (number)"
    } else {
        optionalDescription = nil
    }
    
    // This guard statement adds boilerplate that `flatMap` handles automatically.
    guard let string = optionalString else {
        return nil
    }
    let optionalInt = Int(string)
    ```
    
### Acronyms and Initialisms

Names containing common acronyms and initialisms (such as URL, ID, API, or HTTP) should treat the acronym as a single word, keeping it fully capitalized. This applies to both UpperCamelCase type names and lowerCamelCase variable names. Avoid using mixed-case variants.

This practice improves clarity by treating well-known acronyms as indivisible units, which is how developers mentally read them.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    var requestURL: URL
    let userID: Int
    let htmlContent: String
    
    struct APIClient {
        func downloadHTML() { ... }
    }
    ```

### Use Type Aliases for Clarity

Actively use type aliases (typealias) to give simpler, more descriptive names to complex types **only if the type is used more than once.** This is especially useful for tuples, closures, and generic types with multiple constraints. Using a type alias makes code more readable, self-documenting, and easier to maintain, but creating aliases for types used only once can introduce unnecessary indirection.

A well-named type alias can express the purpose of a complex type, making function signatures and property declarations much clearer.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    // The type alias clearly defines the structure and purpose.
    typealias HTTPResponse = (data: Data?, response: URLResponse?, error: Error?)
    
    func handle(response: HTTPResponse) {
        response.data.map { data in
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    typealias UserFetchCompletion = (Result<[User], APIError>) -> Void
    
    func fetchUsers(completion: @escaping UserFetchCompletion) {
        // ...
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // The complex, inline tuple makes the function signature hard to read.
    func handle(response: (data: Data?, response: URLResponse?, error: Error?)) {
        // ...
    }
    
    // The closure's purpose is not immediately clear from the signature.
    func fetchUsers(completion: @escaping (Result<[User], APIError>) -> Void) {
        // ...
    }
    ```
### Implicit Returns

You should omit the return keyword in functions, computed properties, and closures that are composed of a single expression. The return keyword should only be used when the compiler requires it, for instance, in bodies that contain multiple statements or other declarations.

This practice leverages a modern Swift feature that reduces boilerplate and improves conciseness, making the code's intent clearer. 📜

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    // For a single-line computed property
    var isEnabled: Bool {
        !items.isEmpty
    }
    
    // For a single-expression function
    func square(of number: Int) -> Int {
        number * number
    }
    
    // For a switch statement that is a single expression in a function
    func color(for state: ConnectionState) -> UIColor {
        switch state {
            case .connected: .green
            case .disconnected: .red
            case .connecting: .yellow
        }
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // The return keyword is redundant here.
    var isEnabled: Bool {
        return !items.isEmpty
    }
    
    // The `return` keyword is unnecessary in a single-expression function.
    func square(of number: Int) -> Int {
        return number * number
    }
    
    // Each case is a single expression, so `return` is not needed.
    func color(for state: ConnectionState) -> UIColor {
        switch state {
            case .connected: return .green
            case .disconnected: return .red
            case .connecting: return .yellow
        }
    }
    ```
### Ternary Operators

When a ternary expression (? :) needs to be line-wrapped, a line break is inserted before both the ? and the :. The continuation lines containing these operators are indented exactly +4 from the original line.

This style ensures that all three parts of the expression—the condition, the true case, and the false case—are clearly separated and aligned, which greatly improves readability.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    let accessLevel = user.isAdministrator
        ? "Administrator"
        : "Standard User"
    
    let color = isEnabled
        ? .primary
        : .secondary.withAlphaComponent(0.5)
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // Placing operators at the end of the line makes it harder to scan.
    let accessLevel = user.isAdministrator ?
    "Administrator" :
    "Standard User"
    
    // This inconsistent indentation is confusing.
    let color = isEnabled ? .primary
        : .secondary.withAlphaComponent(0.5)
    ```

### for-where Loops
When the entirety of a for loop’s body would be a single if block testing a condition of the element, the test is placed in the where clause of the for statement instead.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    for item in collection where item.hasProperty {
        // ...
    }
    ```
!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    for item in collection {
        if item.hasProperty {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    
### Numeric Suffixes in Names
Avoid appending arbitrary numbers to the names of types such as classes, structs, protocols, and enums. A type's name should describe its purpose or domain, not its sequence or version. If you need variants of a type, prefer more descriptive names or use generics.

However, using numeric suffixes for properties or local variables is permissible when it is part of a well-defined, non-arbitrary sequence (e.g., coordinates, versioned assets, or mathematical components).

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    struct LineSegment { 
        var point1: CGPoint 
        var point2: CGPoint 
    }

    let themeColor1: Color
    let themeColor2: Color
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    // AVOID: Type names should not be numbered. This creates confusion
    // about the relationship between UserV1 and UserV2.
    // Prefer a single User type with a version property, or use protocols.
    class UserV1 { ... }
    class UserV2 { ... }
    ```

### Documentation Comments
General Format

Documentation comments are written using the triple slash (///). Javadoc-style block comments (/** ... */) are not permitted.

!!! success "Збс"
    ```swift
    /// Returns the numeric value of the given digit.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - digit: The Unicode scalar whose numeric value should be returned.
    ///   - radix: The radix used to compute the numeric value.
    /// - Returns: The numeric value of the scalar.
    func numericValue(of digit: UnicodeScalar, radix: Int = 10) -> Int {
        // ...
    }
    ```

!!! danger "Хуїта"
    ```swift
    /**
     * Returns the numeric value of the given digit.
     */
    func numericValue(of digit: UnicodeScalar, radix: Int = 10) -> Int {
      // ...
    }
    ```
### Compiler Warnings
Code should compile without warnings when feasible. Any warnings that are able to be removed easily by the author must be removed.

A reasonable exception is deprecation warnings, where it may not be possible to immediately migrate to the replacement API, or where an API may be deprecated for external users but must still be supported inside a library during a deprecation period.

### Special Escape Sequences

For any character that has a special escape sequence (`\t`, `\n`, `\r`, `\"`, `\'`, `\\`, and `\0`), that sequence is used rather than the equivalent Unicode (e.g., `\u{000a}`) escape sequence.

### File Header Comments

The boilerplate header comment block automatically added by Xcode to new files should be deleted.

This information, such as the author's name and creation date, is redundant. The version control system (e.g., Git) is the canonical source for a file's history and authorship. Removing this header reduces noise and keeps the focus on the actual code.
